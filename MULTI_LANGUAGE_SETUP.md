# Multi-Language Setup for Dawn Weaver

## Overview
Dawn Weaver now supports both Spanish (default) and English languages with a complete internationalization system.

## Features Added

### 1. Language Service (`lib/services/language_service.dart`)
- Manages language preferences using SharedPreferences
- Default language: Spanish (`es`)
- Supported languages: Spanish (`es`) and English (`en`)
- Provides reactive updates when language changes

### 2. Localization System (`lib/l10n/`)
- `app_localizations.dart` - Abstract base class with all text strings
- `app_localizations_es.dart` - Spanish translations (default)
- `app_localizations_en.dart` - English translations
- `app_localizations_delegate.dart` - Flutter localization delegate

### 3. Updated Screens

#### User Setup Screen (`lib/screens/user_setup_screen.dart`)
- Language selection with Spanish and English options
- Real-time UI updates when language is changed
- Spanish is pre-selected as default
- All text content switches between languages

#### Settings Screen (`lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`)
- Language preference section with toggle buttons
- Immediate language switching
- Localized UI text and messages

#### Main App (`lib/main.dart`)
- Integrated Flutter localization delegates
- Language service integration
- Automatic language detection and application

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. **First Time Setup**: When opening the app, users see the setup screen in Spanish by default
2. **Language Selection**: Users can tap on English or Spanish flags to switch languages
3. **Settings**: Users can change language anytime in Settings > Language section
4. **Persistence**: Language preference is saved and restored on app restart

### For Developers:
1. **Adding New Text**: Add new strings to `app_localizations.dart` abstract class
2. **Translations**: Implement the strings in both `app_localizations_es.dart` and `app_localizations_en.dart`
3. **Usage in Widgets**: Use `AppLocalizations.of(context).stringName` to access localized text

## Example Usage in Code

```dart
// In any widget
final l10n = AppLocalizations.of(context);

Text(l10n.welcome) // Shows "¡Bienvenido!" in Spanish, "Welcome!" in English
Text(l10n.settings) // Shows "Configuración" in Spanish, "Settings" in English
```

## Language Switching Flow

1. User selects language in setup or settings
2. `LanguageService.changeLanguage()` is called
3. Language preference is saved to SharedPreferences
4. `LanguageService` notifies listeners
5. `MaterialApp` rebuilds with new locale
6. All UI text updates automatically

## Default Behavior

- **Default Language**: Spanish (`es`)
- **Fallback**: If a translation is missing, Spanish is used
- **System Integration**: Uses Flutter's built-in localization system
- **Persistence**: Language choice is remembered across app sessions

## Files Modified/Added

### New Files:
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart`
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations_es.dart`
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations_en.dart`
- `lib/l10n/app_localizations_delegate.dart`
- `lib/services/language_service.dart`

### Modified Files:
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_localizations dependency
- `lib/main.dart` - Added localization support and language service
- `lib/screens/user_setup_screen.dart` - Added language selection and localization
- `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart` - Added language settings and localization

## Testing

To test the multi-language functionality:

1. Run the app: `flutter run`
2. Go through the setup process and try switching between Spanish and English
3. Complete setup and go to Settings
4. Change language in Settings and verify all text updates
5. Restart the app to verify language persistence

The app will start in Spanish by default and allow users to switch to English at any time.
